# About
The aaflib is an implementation of the mathematical construct of affine arithmetics in C++. This construct has been introduced by Stolfi et. al. Their c-library can be found at http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~stolfi/EXPORT/software/c/Index.html#libaa. The aaflib is based on the libaffa, a reimplemention of the original library, but has been developed further. It has been used as main calculation library for a spice-like nonlinear circuit simulator. Currently the library and the simulator are developed at the Institute of Microelectronic Systems in Hannover, Germany.
